Left off: 
  Board and Staff Members CMA Page
    a. create board list page for ordering
    b. create staff list page for ordering
    c. create edit board member page for deletion/addition and update
    d. create edit staff member page for deletion/addition and update


To Do:
  Update to have pages with subnavs as in resources-categories as a demo right now
    notices, faq, staff, board, anything with multiple functions (add/manage) so that the sidebar is a section
      and the subnav splits up the possible actions
  Destroy ajcalendar functionality
  Do I need to create empty states for all content in case no rows return?
