To Do:
  Do I need to create empty states for all content in case no rows return?
  Notices : remove notice typing drop-down, autoselect as general
  Notices : Make sure the inline help and helpfile indicate what happens in all cases
  ResCategories : Feature categories ( up to two ) + homepage navs need submenus for the Resources parent that is two featured cats = FAQ
    subpage navs can have all categories + FAQ
  CDA : Implement disabled states
      agenda buttons: .Meeting__button--disabled
      pagination: .Pagination__PrevNext--disabled

Feature Questions
  (CDA) Screenshots inside of help files?

Migration --
Add require_once(APPPATH.'core/EXT_AdminController'.EXT)
  To each admin and script controller
Rename all controller names to single-upper-case (Editcalendar, Dashboard) filenames

ENV -> Production
  .htaccess - RewriteBase /smmwc to /folder on production env
  update production base_url in config.php
  update production
  may have to update home.php to have a double-forward-slash(//) in front of styles_root echo on style.min.css
    if the style doesn't get loaded on prod

ENV -> Dev
.htaccess RewriteBase to /smmwc
database.php -> development group
index.php -> development env 


FEAT CREEP:
make a CI_Controller -> EXT_Controller -> EXT_CDA_Controller | EXT_CMA_Controller for best code separation
CI_Controller -> EXT_Controller -> CDA/CDA -> Pages
CI_Controller -> EXT_ScriptTroller -> Pages
